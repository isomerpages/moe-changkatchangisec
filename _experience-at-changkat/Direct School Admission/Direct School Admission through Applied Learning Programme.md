### **Talent Area: STEM - AEROSPACE AND AVIATION**

**Introduction**  

In 2015, Changkat Changi Secondary School started our Applied Learning Programme titled Student-centered Opportunities for AeRospace industry (SOAR).

  

SOAR aims to develop Changkateers by connecting Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) knowledge across subject disciplines and developing thinking skills by providing a safe environment for Changkateers to stretch their imagination. It also aims to prepare Changkateers for the future by appreciating the relevance of their learning beyond the classroom, provide authentic situations for Changkateers to apply STEM knowledge to address real world problems, and explore STEM-related post-secondary and career opportunities.

  

All lower secondary Changkateers undergo weekly ALP lessons based on the context of Aviation where they learn about Principles of Flight, build gliders and practise drone programming. Students who show interest and aptitude will receive opportunities to participate in competitions such as Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition (SAFMC), attend workshops conducted by our tertiary partners such as Singapore Polytechnic, and participate in aviation exchange programme and visit the aviation hub in Toulouse, France..
