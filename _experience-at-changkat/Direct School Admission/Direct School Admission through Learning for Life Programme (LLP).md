### Talent Area: Community Youth Leadership

 **Introduction**  

In 2014, Changkat Changi Secondary School started it’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) entitled Service and Leadership Through School To Nation. This Community Youth Leadership (CYL) programme aims to develop future leaders who are able to impact the community positively.  The programme develops the leadership qualities in students and involves them in planning and carrying out Values in Action (VIA) projects to improve the school and community.  The programme hopes to equip student leaders with the aptitude and skills to become active advocates for causes that they are passionate about.   

The students will be given opportunities to attend training sessions and platforms to acquire explicit skills on leadership and service learning.  The school works closely with community partners to help students understand issues that various communities face.  Students will then be given opportunities to lead their peers in organising and completing Values in Action projects to act on these community issues. Through this experience, the students develop the 21st century competencies to better prepare them for the future.
