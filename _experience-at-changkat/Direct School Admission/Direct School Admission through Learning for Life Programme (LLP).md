<h5>FAQ</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>How many places can CCSS Secondary offer in DSA Exercise?</strong>
<br>All secondary schools can admit up to 20% of their 2026 S1 non-Integrated
Programme (non-IP) intake via the DSA-Sec. This allows students to better
access school programmes to grow their talents and interests through DSA.
<br>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How does it value-add to my child?</strong>
<br>Students will have the opportunity to develop their own leadership skills
and apply these skills in carrying out community improvement projects.
These skill sets acquired during the LLP will be very useful soft skills
which are highly applicable and sought after in the workforce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My child is an international student / Home-schooled / returning Singapore Citizen / SPR not studying in a local school. Can he/she apply for DSA?</strong>
<br>Other applicants not studying in MOE mainstream primary schools: They
need to apply for a Registration Number (RGxxxxxxx) before they can apply
through the DSA-Sec Portal. Schools may refer them to MOE website at:&nbsp;
<a href="https://go.gov.sg/nmsdsa-sec-application" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/nmsdsa-sec-application</a>.</p>
<p>Applicants who are not studying in MOE mainstream primary schools include
Returning Singaporeans, International Students studying overseas or in
local international schools, students in Special Education Schools (e.g.
Pathlight) and home-schoolers. For all shortlisted International Students,
schools should remind them that they are required to take and fulfil the
requirements of the Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS)
test to be successful in DSA.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do my child/ward have to take the PSLE?</strong>
<br>Students who take up Confirmed Offers or Waiting List Offers by schools
during the DSA-Sec Exercise are still required to take the Primary School
Leaving Examination (PSLE). Those who take up Confirmed Offers are guaranteed
a place in the school that has extended them an offer, provided that their
PSLE results meet the minimum requirement for a course [Express/ Normal
(Academic)/ Normal (Technical)] offered by the school. Should the child
obtain a PSLE score that lies between 2 streams, he/she will be able to
opt for the preferred stream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can my child/ward apply for transfer after getting a confirmed place?</strong>
<br>Students are also&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;allowed to transfer to
another school after the release of the PSLE results. They are expected
to honour the commitment to the posted DSA schools for the duration of
the programme they are admitted to.</p>
