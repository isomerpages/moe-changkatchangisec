<h3><strong>Talent Area: CCA - Physical Sports</strong></h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The Physical Sports DSA student will be able to pursue his sporting passion
holistically, develop his skills and knowledge, specific to his sport,
setting personal challenges and achieving sporting excellence, anchored
on school values.</p>
<p>The Physical Sports Development Programme will provide learning opportunities
for students to learn and apply sports-specific skills in their talent
areas. The emphasis will be on learning and enjoyment through developmentally
appropriate experiences. Specialised and intensive training for high performance
will also be planned for developmentally faster students to achieve sporting
excellence.</p>
<p>Students who join us through DSA will have the opportunities to further
develop their areas of talent under the guidance of our dedicated teachers,
experienced instructors, and build strong camaraderie with their committed
peers. Students can also look forward to representing the school in the
National School Games (NSG) and other external competitions.</p>
<p>Changkat will be offering DSA places to boys and girls in the following
areas of talent:</p>
