<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In Changkat Changi Secondary School, we envision every student in the
school to <strong>Lead with Respect, Serve with Humility</strong>. We believe
in the potential of students - that their minds, character and lives can
be shaped. We create opportunities for our students to develop their character
and leadership competencies through CCA. Students who join us through DSA
will have the opportunities to further develop their areas of talent under
the guidance of our dedicated teachers, experienced instructors, and build
strong camaraderie with their committed peers. Students can also look forward
to representing the school in the National School Games (NSG), Singapore
Youth Festival (SYF) and other external competitions.</p>

<h4>Why join us?</h4>
<p>In Changkat, we create opportunities for our students to develop their
character and leadership competencies through CCA. Our team of dedicated
teachers and experienced coaches are committed to help students find the
best versions of themselves in their area of talent, through a comprehensive
training programme and ample opportunities in competitions to form part
of their learning experiences.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>FAQ</h4>
<p><strong>1. How many places can CCSS offer in DSA Exercise?<br></strong>All
secondary schools can admit up to 20% of their 2025 S1 non-Integrated Programme
(non-IP) intake via the DSA-Sec. This allows students to better access
school programmes to grow their talents and interests through DSA.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2. How does it value-add to my child?</strong>
</p>
<p>Your child will be allocated to the CCA which they are being offered to
and be further developed in their area of talent. They will also be given
opportunities to participate in external competitions including the National
School Games.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;My child is an international student / Home-schooled / returning Singapore Citizen / SPR not studying in a local school. Can he/she apply for DSA?</strong>
</p>
<p>Other applicants not studying in MOE mainstream primary schools need to
apply for a Registration Number (RGxxxxxxx) before they can apply through
the DSA-Sec Portal. Schools may refer them to MOE website at: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/nmsdsa-sec-application" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/nmsdsa-sec-application</a>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Applicants who are not studying in MOE mainstream primary schools include
Returning Singaporeans, International Students studying overseas or in
local international schools, students in Special Education Schools (e.g.
Pathlight) and home-schoolers. For all shortlisted International Students,
schools should remind them that they are required to take and fulfil the
requirements of the Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS)
test to be successful in DSA.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4. Does my child/ward have to take the PSLE?</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who take up Confirmed Offers or Waiting List Offers by schools
during the DSA-Sec Exercise are still required to take the Primary School
Leaving Examination (PSLE). Those who take up Confirmed Offers are guaranteed
a place in the school that has extended them an offer, provided that their
PSLE results meet the minimum requirement for a course [Express/ Normal
(Academic)/ Normal (Technical)] offered by the school. Should the child
obtain a PSLE score that lies between 2 streams, he/she will be able to
opt for the preferred stream.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>5. Can my child/ward apply for transfer after getting a confirmed place?</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are also <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to transfer to another school
after the release of the PSLE results. They are expected to honour the
commitment to the posted DSA schools for the duration of the programme
they are admitted to.</p>
