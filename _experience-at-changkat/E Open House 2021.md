|Tasmeen Tan (Class of 2016)  <br>Undergraduate @ Singapore Management University  <br>Changkat Changi Secondary School Alumni  <br>Recipient of the Asiamalls Management Prize and the Beacon Consulting Prize| "As students of Changkat Changi, our school values are often emphasized in our school days and inculcated in us through our Character and Citizenship classes. We instill these values through various experiences and events in school in which it has provided us with many learning opportunities aside from academic wise for students to build their character and personal growth. Examples of opportunities include various workshops such as leadership and teambuilding and seminars to better prepare students for the next phase in life. One value; Integrity, stood out to me the most. Changkat Changi gave students responsibilities such as leadership roles in class. It made me realise the value of being the leader of any group projects, allowing me to gain valuable leadership qualities and learn how to work with different people. I believe my experience at Changkat Changi has played a part in allowing me to achieve what I have accomplished today."|
