The Science department aims to inspire Changkateers to learn with passion and be inquisitive in their learning of Science.&nbsp; With the use of Science and Technology, we strive to engage our students in scientific inquiry and provide opportunities for our students to experience the real-world relevance of Science.  
  
**Key Programmes:**

*   Our Science Talent Development Programme (TDP) develops and trains students who is passionate in Science and wants to pursue their talent in the area of Science.&nbsp;
*   In this extraordinary year, our TDP students took part in ‘Fun with electronics’ workshops from Science Centre and Marine Seakeepers.&nbsp;
*   A selected group of students also participated in UNSW Global Assessment (ICAS 2020) to stretch their potential in the pursuit of excellence.&nbsp;
*   Engaging Science curriculum developed by Professional Learning Teams in Physics and in Chemistry during Full Home-based Learning and Blended Learning  
    

  
**Achievements:**  
  
UNSW Global Assessment (ICAS 2020)  

*   2 Distinctions
*   2 Merit
