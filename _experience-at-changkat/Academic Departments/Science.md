The Science department aims to inspire Changkateers to learn with passion and be inquisitive in their learning of Science.  With the use of Science and Technology, we strive to engage our students in scientific inquiry and provide opportunities for our students to experience the real-world relevance of Science.  
  
**Key Programmes:**

*   Our Science Talent Development Programme (TDP) develops and trains students who is passionate in Science and wants to pursue their talent in the area of Science. 
*   In this extraordinary year, our TDP students took part in ‘Fun with electronics’ workshops from Science Centre and Marine Seakeepers. 
*   A selected group of students also participated in UNSW Global Assessment (ICAS 2020) to stretch their potential in the pursuit of excellence. 
*   Engaging Science curriculum developed by Professional Learning Teams in Physics and in Chemistry during Full Home-based Learning and Blended Learning  
    

  
**Achievements:**  
  
UNSW Global Assessment (ICAS 2020)  

*   2 Distinctions
*   2 Merit
