<p><strong>Our Vision and Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe that&nbsp;<strong>every Changkateer</strong>&nbsp;can be a&nbsp;<strong>confident and creative problem-solver.</strong>&nbsp;We're
committed to helping students understand how mathematics goes beyond numbers,
connecting them with the skills they need for life.</p>
<p>With a forward-thinking curriculum based on the&nbsp;<strong>Singapore Mathematics Framework&nbsp;</strong>and
key Big Ideas in Mathematics we foster&nbsp;<strong>Critical, Adaptive, and Inventive (CAIT)</strong>,
ensuring students are&nbsp;<strong>prepared for real-world challenges.</strong>&nbsp;Our
programmes are designed to develop<strong>&nbsp;self-directed learners, critical thinkers, and collaborators.</strong>

<p><strong>Key Programmes:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Supporting Every Learner</strong>
</p>
<p>We are dedicated to supporting our students in their learning journey,
as we aim to make mathematics accessible and enjoyable for every student.</p>
<p><strong>Recognition and Awards</strong>&nbsp;– Top 3 students in each
class of the Term. To celebrate and recognise students who demonstrate&nbsp;<strong>self-directedness and resilience&nbsp;</strong>in
their learning with academic excellence for mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Fostering Talent and Critical Thinking</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Talent Development Programme (TDP) is designed to nurture students
with advanced mathematical skills and to develop them into confident problem-solvers
who are ready to meet the demands of the future. These students are introduced
to how Mathematics is used in careers in financial sector such as Scor.</p>

</div>
<p>These programmes create opportunities for students to appreciate mathematics
and developing them into&nbsp;<strong>Critical, Adaptive, and Inventive Thinkers.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Competitions and Recognition</strong>
</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on nurturing not only academic excellence but also
innovation and problem-solving. Our students are given opportunities to
participate in various mathematics and coding challenges, earning commendations
and awards in both national and international platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Looking Ahead: 2025 and Beyond</strong>
</p>
<p>Our 2025 workplan highlights our commitment to&nbsp;<strong>building confident communicators</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>critical thinkers.</strong>&nbsp;Integrating
opportunities for students to apply Computational Thinking (CT) in Mathematics
helps develop their critical thinking, problem-solving, and digital literacy
skills—key competencies that computational thinking supports.</p>
<p>Students are also introduced to problems with real-life context via Problems
in Real World Context (<strong>PRWC</strong>) questions in examinations,
which challenge students to apply their higher-order thinking skills to
solve real-world Problems, further emphasizing our goal of nurturing and
developing creative problem-solvers.</p>
<p>At the Mathematics Department, we believe in preparing students not just
for examinations, but for life.</p>
