The Mathematics department aims to develop students into effective problem-solvers who are resilient and possess a love for learning.  Through the use of a range of pedagogical tools and strategies, teachers seek to bring about engaged learning in the subjects.  

**Key Programmes:**

1.  **Student-focused programmes**

*   **Australian Math Competition (Sec 1-3)**  
    We continued with the annual Australian Mathematics Competition this year. In-house training by our very own teachers was conducted to prepare our students for the competition.   
    
*   **e-Mathematics Week (All Levels & Streams)**  
    In view of COVID-19, this annual event was moved online. There were interesting activities spread over 4 days that not only sustained the usual enthusiasm of past years, but garnered wider participation.  
    

3.  **Teacher-focused programmes**

*   **Professional Learning Teams (PLT)**  
    The project this year focused on TPACK – a framework that integrates technological, pedagogical and content knowledge to design active learning experience with technology.  
    

  
**Achievements in the Australian Mathematics Competition 2020:**
