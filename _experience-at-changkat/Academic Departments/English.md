The English Language Department aims to develop students into empathetic communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers who are confident and competent in their use of the English Language. To this end, the department offers structured programmes which allow students to discover their passions in the various language areas. In particular, the Public Speaking Programme helps our students grow as orators.  

**Key Programmes:**

*   Talent Development Programme
<br> - Public Speaking Programme
<br> - Writer's Academy
<br> - Literature
*   Drama in Sec 1 EL Curriculum
*   English Literature Enrichment workshop and Learning Journey 
    

  
Given the positive learning experiences our Changkateers had last year, we continued to incorporate Drama into the Sec 1 curriculum where the students took time each week in Term 2 to learn how to present themselves confidently and learn the basics of a drama performance. Our students in the Public Speaking Programme continue to hone their talent in speaking and acting in various school events throughout the year. A highlight of our Secondary 3 curriculum was an inter-class debate where students engaged in discourse on various topics related to the theme of Law and Justice.
