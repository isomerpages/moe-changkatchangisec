The English Language Department aims to develop students into empathetic communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers who are confident and competent in their use of the English Language. To this end, the department offers structured programmes which allow students to discover their passions in the various language areas. In particular, the Public Speaking Programme helps our students grow as orators.  

**Key Programmes:**

*   English Literature Enrichment workshops 
*   Talent Development Programme 
*   Public Speaking Programme 
*   English Drama Society 
*   Public Speaking competitions & platforms 
*   Creative Writing competitions & platforms  
    

  
This year, the English Drama Society has come under the fold of the English Language Department’s Talent Development Programme where students will develop both their oratorical skills and in the performing arts. One of our student, Siti Hawa Binte Mohamad Isa (3E2) was also selected as emcee for the SYFgoesOnline Presentations. Our EL teachers continue to be professionally developed by redesigning the school curriculum according to the new EL Syllabus 2020.
