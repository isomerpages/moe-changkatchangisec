<p>The English Language Department aims to develop students into empathetic
communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers who are confident
and competent in their use of the English Language. To this end, the department
offers structured programmes which allow students to discover their passions
in the various language areas. In particular, the Public Speaking Programme
helps our students grow as orators.</p>
<p><strong>Key Programmes:</strong>

<p>Given the positive learning experiences our Changkateers had last year,
we continued to incorporate Drama into the Sec 1 curriculum where the students
took time each week in Term 2 to learn how to present themselves confidently
and learn the basics of a drama performance. Our students in the Public
Speaking Programme continue to hone their talent in speaking and acting
in various school events throughout the year. A highlight of our Secondary
3 curriculum was an inter-class debate where students engaged in discourse
on various topics related to the theme of Law and Justice.</p>
