<p>The Physical Education Department aims to promote a healthy lifestyle
through an engaging PE curriculum. Students acquire the necessary skills
and knowledge on the various sports taught at each level, and were given
the opportunity to display what they have learnt during the inter-class
tournaments.</p>
<p>To promote the spirit of sportsmanship and friendly competition between
the four Houses - Eagle, Falcon, Harrier and Hawk, various competitions
of different natures were planned and organised.</p>
<p>The music team provides strong music instructional programme such as GarageBand,
Soundscape, STOMP and Ukulele. Students learn to create music in authentic
settings and appreciate the relevance and value of the skills they have
learnt.</p>
