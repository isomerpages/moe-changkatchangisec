The Physical Education Department aims to promote a healthy lifestyle through an engaging PE curriculum. Students acquire the necessary skills and knowledge on the various sports taught at each level, and were given the opportunity to display what they have learnt during the inter-class tournaments.  
  

To promote the spirit of sportsmanship and friendly competition between the four Houses - Eagle, Falcon, Harrier and Hawk, various competitions of different natures were planned and organised.  
  

The music team provides strong music instructional programme such as GarageBand, Soundscape, STOMP and Ukulele. Students learn to create music in authentic settings and appreciate the relevance and value of the skills they have learnt.  

  

**Key Programmes:**

  
*   Annual Cross-Country Run
*   Sports Fiesta
*   Inter-class games
*   House Olympics
