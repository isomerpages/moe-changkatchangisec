<h5>DESIGN &amp; TECHNOLOGY (D&amp;T)</h5>
<p>The D&amp;T unit aims to prepare students to participate in tomorrow’s
rapidly changing world by creating opportunities for students to think
creatively through the design process in designing and making. We structure
our curriculum to promote thinking and tinkering to develop solutions.</p>
<p>Students are:</p>

<h5>NUTRITION AND FOOD SCIENCE (NFS)</h5>
<p><strong>Food and Consumer Education (Lower secondary)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Food and Consumer Education (FCE) syllabus equips students with essential
knowledge and skills to navigate evolving social, economic, and technological
changes. It promotes financial literacy, sustainable consumption, and digital
awareness while fostering social and emotional competencies for responsible
decision-making. Aligned with national initiatives like the Singapore Green
Plan 2030, the curriculum prepares students to be discerning consumers
and active contributors to society. The Applied Module (AM) further enhances
learning by allowing students to deepen their understanding and develop
core skills such as creative thinking, needs analysis, and decision-making,
ensuring they are well-prepared for future challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Food and Nutrition (Upper secondary)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) curriculum equips students with essential
knowledge in nutrition, food literacy, and sustainability, enabling them
to make informed dietary choices and address food security challenges in
Singapore. By applying food science principles, students learn to prepare
nutritious meals, reduce diet-related risks, and adopt responsible consumption
habits. Aligned with the Desired Outcomes of Education (DOE), the syllabus
nurtures responsible citizens who advocate for healthy eating and innovative
food solutions. Coursework process skills are integrated into the curriculum,
providing opportunities for hands-on learning and self-directed exploration,
ensuring students are well-prepared for a rapidly evolving world.</p>
