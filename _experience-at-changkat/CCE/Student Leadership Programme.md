<h4><strong>The Student Council: Leading with Heart and Purpose</strong></h4>
<p>The Student Council is the heartbeat of our school—an energetic and dedicated
team committed to creating a positive, inclusive, and spirited environment
for all. Their leadership plays a vital role in strengthening our school
community, championing student voice, and addressing concerns with care
and initiative.</p>
<p>Guided by a clear vision to unlock potential and drive progress, the Student
Council oversaw key platforms to empower student representation, such as
the Student Council Presidential Election, the Student Suggestion Scheme—including
the Online Suggestion Portal—and Town Hall Discussions. They also enriched
signature events like the Student Leaders’ Investiture and Teachers’ Day
Celebrations, adding meaningful touches that brought people together and
made lasting memories.</p>
<p>More than just a leadership body, the Student Council is a team of passionate
individuals who lead with integrity, resilience, and a deep sense of responsibility.
Their contributions have left a lasting impact, making our school a better
place for all.</p>
