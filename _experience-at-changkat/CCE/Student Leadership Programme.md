<h4><strong>The Student Council: Leading with Heart and Purpose</strong></h4>
<p>At the pinnacle of our school’s student leadership structure stands the
Student Council—the heartbeat of our community. This energetic and dedicated
team is committed to fostering a positive, inclusive, and spirited school
environment. Their leadership plays a vital role in amplifying student
voice, strengthening our sense of community, and addressing concerns with
empathy and initiative.</p>
<p>Driven by a clear vision to unlock potential and inspire progress, the
Student Council leads key initiatives that empower student representation.
These include the Student Council Presidential Election, the Student Suggestion
Scheme—featuring the Online Suggestion Portal—and Town Hall Discussions.
They also elevate signature events like the Student Leaders’ Investiture
and Teachers’ Day Celebrations, adding thoughtful touches that bring people
together and create lasting memories.</p>
<p>More than just a leadership body, the Student Council is a team of passionate
individuals who lead with integrity, resilience, and a strong sense of
purpose. Their contributions continue to shape a school culture where every
student feels seen, heard, and valued.</p>
