These student exchange programmes provided a rare and memorable experience for our students. It allows them to experience a different culture firsthand, forge international friendships, and gain a deeper understanding of global perspectives.

**15 - 21 May 2024**

We visited Airbus Assembly Line in our recent Overseas Trip to Toulouse, France where we also had a school exchange with Lycee Saint Exupery. The exchange program also provides a unique opportunity for our students to engage in aviation-related activities and visit notable sites in France. This hands-on experience in a different country will broaden their knowledge and enhance their passion for the aviation field.
