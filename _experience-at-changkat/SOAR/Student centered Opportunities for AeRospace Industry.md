<center>SOAR&nbsp;at CCSS is an applied learning programme which is focused on the Aerospace and Aviation Management Industry where students will experience aviation related activities and enrichment. It also aims to develop knowledge and skills of applied learning in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics for our students.</center>

**_SOAR_**&nbsp;**is integrated in our Curriculum**
----------------------------------------------

All secondary 1 and 2 students undergo aviation based curriculum lessons fortnightly. These lessons involve elements of STEM and 21 CCs to ignite students’ interests in aviation and develop their understanding of aeronautics. Some of the lessons activities include building of gliders, understanding the physics and dynamics of flight, drones and flight simulation. Below are 2 basic activities that help students to understand flight.

**An Enriching Aviation Experience**
------------------------------------

Outside of the classrooms, assembly talks were held where guests from Singapore Airline Engineering and Singapore Airlines were invited to give a talk on the aerospace industry. Passionate Sec 2 and sec 3 students went to attend the Aviation Open House at Suntec City Expo and Singapore Airshow. Connecting our students to the relevant and current industrial knowledge so that we can bring the education to life, and life to education. with specific emphasis on the aviation industry and importance of Singapore as an aviation hub.

Enriching the students further, students were selected and trained to take part in external competitions. For example, in the Aerochallenge at Ngee Ann Polytechnic,Â&nbsp;our secondary three Physics students, visited Temasek Polytechnic and ITE for their aerospace/aviation based enrichment workshop to learn more aviation related skills such as the designing of aircrafts.



**Strong Partnerships with the Aviation Industries**
----------------------------------------------------

To have a more holistic programme, SOAR have partnerships with institute of higher learning such as Singapore Polytechnic, Temasek Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic and ITE. SOAR is also fortunate to have partners in the Aviation Industries such as CAAS, SIA EC and Rolls Royce. Visits to our partners such as Rolls Royce adds value to learning more about the aviation industries for both staff and students. On the annual STEM ALP day, our school collaborated with STEM professionals from Rolls Royce and carried out Pet rocket and autonomous vehicles activities.

**Facilities to match the Aviation Experience**
-----------------------------------------------

Infrastructure was upgraded to match the demands of a unique Aviation Experience. Our school open our first ever ICT integrated ALP room to facilitate collaborative learning and develop 21 ccs in our students during the STEM based lessons.

There is also a new aviation career corner.&nbsp; Changkateers are able to learn more about the possible careers in Aviation and have a good idea and information on the courses they need to pursue for their next phase of their education pathway.
