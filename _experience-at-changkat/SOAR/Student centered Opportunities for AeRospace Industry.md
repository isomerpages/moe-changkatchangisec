<center>SOAR at CCSS is an applied learning programme which is focused on the Aerospace and Aviation Management Industry where students will experience aviation related activities and enrichment. It also aims to develop knowledge and skills of applied learning in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics for our students.</center>

**_SOAR_** **is integrated in our Curriculum**
----------------------------------------------

All secondary 1 and 2 students undergo a 10 to 11 weeks of 1.5 hours aviation based curriculum lessons. These lessons involve elements of STEM and 21 CCs to ignite studentsâ€™ interests in aviation and develop their understanding of aeronautics. Some of the lessons activities include building of paper aircrafts, understanding the physics and dynamics of flight. Below are 2 basic activities that help students to understand flight.

**An Enriching Aviation Experience**
------------------------------------

Outside of the classrooms, assembly talks were held during the aviation week where guests from Singapore Airline Engineering and Singapore Airlines were invited to give a talk on the aerospace industry. Passionate Sec 2 and sec 3 students went to attend the Aviation Open House at Suntec City Expo

Enriching the students further, students were selected and trained to take part in external competitions. For example, in the Aerochallenge at Ngee Ann Polytechnic,Â our secondary three Physics students, visited Temasek Polytechnic and ITE for their aerospace/aviation based enrichment workshop to learn more aviation related skills such as the designing of aircrafts.

In June 2016, the learning experience took students overseas to NASA in Houston together with Mr Melvin Ng, HOD/Science, and Mr Patrick Ang! The students also won awards for Excellence in Mission Design - Scientific Challenge and Commercial Presentation during this trip.

**Strong Partnerships with the Aviation Industries**
----------------------------------------------------

To have a more holistic programme, SOAR have partnerships with institute of higher learning such as Temasek Polytechnic and ITE. SOAR is also fortunate to have partners in the Aviation Industries such as CAAS, SIA and Rolls Royce. Visits to our partners such as Rolls Royce adds value to learning more about the aviation industries for both staff and students.
