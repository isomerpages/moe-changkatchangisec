We instill these values through various experiences and events in school in which it has provided us with many learning opportunities aside from academic wise for students to build their character and personal growth. Examples of opportunities include various workshops such as leadership and teambuilding and seminars to better prepare students for the next phase in life. One value; Integrity, stood out to me the most. Changkat Changi gave students responsibilities such as leadership roles in class. It made me realise the value of being the leader of any group projects, allowing me to gain valuable leadership qualities and learn how to work with different people. I believe my experience at Changkat Changi has played a part in allowing me to achieve what I have accomplished today."</strong></td>

The school has provided me with ample opportunities to develop myself and to pursue my passion. As a student councillor, I was given the chance to assist in the planning and execution of learning journeys and various other school events. Additionally, the science competitions that I participated in have also given me more exposure to various global issues. Through these experiences, I learnt to work as a critical thinker and overcame different challenges to get to where I am today.</strong><br><strong>Although there were many enjoyable moments in Changkat Changi, the most memorable event that I will always remember is the Unity Scientific Innovation Challenge competition in 2014. It was a national science competition to apply scientific principles to develop an innovative solution to various issues. That was undoubtedly a challenging competition for me as it was the first time that I was exposed to such scientific issues. Eventually, with the assiduity and stalwart support from my teachers, my team was rewarded with the Most Innovative Project and I learnt to step out of my comfort zone to voice out my opinion and to view issues from various perspectives. The Changkat Challenge in 2016 is also a memorable event for me. The graduating cohort that year was given the opportunity to paint on the walls in the school. That was a great bonding session for our class as we work together to paint on the wall. The friendships forged and the memories made while I was in Changkat Changi will always stay with me."</strong></td>

The friendships forged, memories made and the teachers who have helped me in so many ways even beyond the academics. Being the Vice-Chairman of my class when I was in Secondary 3 and 4 allowed me to build upon my leadership skills and become more competent in organising events such as class bonding sessions and celebrations. Furthermore, I had the chance to participate in the International Model United Nations Conference (IMUNC) in 2015 where I got to step out of my comfort zone and understand the importance of keeping up with the current affairs locally and internationally. As such, Changkat Changi had provided me with many opportunities to gain exposure and develop my skills."</strong></td>
