I really have to thank the teachers that pushed me. The friends I made while I was there also made me feel really at home in the school. All in all Changkat Changi really helped me grow as a student and as a person!"|

|Tasmeen Tan (Class of 2016)  <br>Undergraduate @ Singapore Management University  <br>Changkat Changi Secondary School Alumni  <br>Recipient of the Asiamalls Management Prize and the Beacon Consulting Prize| "As students of Changkat Changi, our school values are often emphasized in our school days and inculcated in us through our Character and Citizenship classes. We instill these values through various experiences and events in school in which it has provided us with many learning opportunities aside from academic wise for students to build their character and personal growth. Examples of opportunities include various workshops such as leadership and teambuilding and seminars to better prepare students for the next phase in life. One value; Integrity, stood out to me the most. Changkat Changi gave students responsibilities such as leadership roles in class. It made me realise the value of being the leader of any group projects, allowing me to gain valuable leadership qualities and learn how to work with different people. I believe my experience at Changkat Changi has played a part in allowing me to achieve what I have accomplished today."|

| Tammy Soh (Class of 2016)  <br>Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences Undergraduate @ National University of Singapore  <br>Recipient of the Jumbo Group of Restaurants Course Bronze Medal|"The strong support system in Changkat Changi has helped me realize my true potential to get to where I am today. The school has provided me with ample opportunities to develop myself and to pursue my passion. As a student councillor, I was given the chance to assist in the planning and execution of learning journeys and various other school events. Additionally, the science competitions that I participated in have also given me more exposure to various global issues. Through these experiences, I learnt to work as a critical thinker and overcame different challenges to get to where I am today.<br>Although there were many enjoyable moments in Changkat Changi, the most memorable event that I will always remember is the Unity Scientific Innovation Challenge competition in 2014. It was a national science competition to apply scientific principles to develop an innovative solution to various issues. That was undoubtedly a challenging competition for me as it was the first time that I was exposed to such scientific issues. Eventually, with the assiduity and stalwart support from my teachers, my team was rewarded with the Most Innovative Project and I learnt to step out of my comfort zone to voice out my opinion and to view issues from various perspectives. The Changkat Challenge in 2016 is also a memorable event for me. The graduating cohort that year was given the opportunity to paint on the walls in the school. That was a great bonding session for our class as we work together to paint on the wall. The friendships forged and the memories made while I was in Changkat Changi will always stay with me."|

|Lam Jia Yi (Class of 2016)  <br>Business School Undergraduate @ Nanyang Technological University  <br>Changkat Changi Secondary School Alumni  <br>Recipient of the Kelly Services Course Bronze Medal| "I am proud to be a Changkateer because it has shaped me into who I am today. Having been part of the Changkat family is a fond memory that I would always look back to even after graduation. The friendships forged, memories made and the teachers who have helped me in so many ways even beyond the academics. Being the Vice-Chairman of my class when I was in Secondary 3 and 4 allowed me to build upon my leadership skills and become more competent in organising events such as class bonding sessions and celebrations. Furthermore, I had the chance to participate in the International Model United Nations Conference (IMUNC) in 2015 where I got to step out of my comfort zone and understand the importance of keeping up with the current affairs locally and internationally. As such, Changkat Changi had provided me with many opportunities to gain exposure and develop my skills."|

I can't choose so I will list some. One would be being part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations. I am also very honoured to take part of the first House Olympics where the school was filled with a joyous atmosphere. The last would be the Changkat Challenge where we are all dressed in yellow (the shirt for the event) buzzing around in our different activities. Our class painted a mural of a tree which symbolised our journey in school! I have made so many great memories at Changkat that I couldn't list them all."|

|Nabillah Binte Ismail (Class of 2015)  <br>Process Associate @ Genpact  <br>Changkat Changi Secondary School Alumni| "What makes me proud to be a Changkateer? Honestly it was the culture of the school. It was this unique warm and ‘homey’ feeling I got whenever I went to school, getting to see and socialise with my friends and teachers. The lifelong friends I made  at Changkat Changi became my support system when I was struggling with academic work. Even now when we are transitioning into adulthood, they are still by my side. On top of that, being in a CCA also helped me shape the professional side of myself. It gave me a taste of what discipline was — things like punctuality, teamwork and upholding your responsibility as a leader."|

Additionally, if you have any problems you can always rely on the teachers and staff who are ready to go the extra mile for you.

|Indra D/O Balakrishnan (Class of 2016)  <br>Currently studying a Diploma in Fine Arts @ LASALLE College of the Arts  <br>Changkat Changi Secondary School Alumni| "I am truly proud to call myself a Changkateer because Changkat Changi helped shape me to be the responsible, independent, and goal driven young lady I am today. The strong values and morals have taught me to stand up for what I believe in, even in the face of handling tough circumstances. Changkat Changi also helped me to get to where I am today, because of the constant affirmation and recognition I received for my performances academically and non-academically. It motivated me to strive better in everything I did. Moreover, the valuable life lessons and core values I had learnt during my CCA (Girl Guides) days were also very useful as they polished my attitude towards overcoming hardship which kept me optimistic through my struggles."|
