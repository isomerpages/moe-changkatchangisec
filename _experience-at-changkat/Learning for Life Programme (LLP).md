<h3><strong>A</strong>dopt <strong>S</strong>ustainability, <strong>C</strong>ommunicate <strong>E</strong>ffectively, <strong>N</strong>avigate <strong>D</strong>iversity: Leadership in Sustainability</h3>
<p>ASCEND at CCSS is our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) that provides
students with a unique and meaningful journey in Leadership and Sustainability.
Designed to empower students with 21st-century competencies, ASCEND equips
Changkateers with the skills to lead, inspire, and make a difference in
their communities — especially in advancing Singapore’s green future.</p>

<p>At the heart of ASCEND is the Kouzes and Posner’s Student Leadership Challenge
(K&amp;P) and the principles of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. These foundations
help students develop strong leadership values and the confidence to advocate
for change.</p>

<h4>ASCEND is integrated in our Curriculum</h4>
<p>Across the four years, every student experiences LLP lessons and applies
the five K&amp;P leadership practices in hands-on sustainability projects
that grow in scope and impact.</p>

<h4>Sprouting Passionate Advocates in Sustainability</h4>

<h4>Empowered to Lead, Inspired to Serve</h4>
<p>Leadership at Changkat goes beyond titles — it is lived through action.
Throughout the year, student leaders attended training, led CCA activities,
organised school-wide events, and mentored juniors, gaining invaluable
experience in leading teams and navigating differences from external competitions
and conferences.</p>

<p>This year, selected student leaders also took part in two unique learning
opportunities:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Changpreneur: In this alumni-supported programme, students explored entrepreneurship
and sustainability, developed business ideas, and pitched them to potential
investors over a series of eight enriching sessions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A dialogue session with the Portuguese Ambassador on Multilateralism and
International Cooperation, offering students a rare chance to engage with
global issues and diplomacy.</p>

<p>Through ASCEND, our students are not just learning about leadership and
sustainability — they are living it. They are stepping forward, speaking
up, and making a tangible difference in their school, community, and beyond.</p>
