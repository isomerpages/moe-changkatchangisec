_Dream, Discover, Destiny_
--------------------------

The Annual Speech & Prize-Giving Day is an event for us to celebrate the achievements of our Changkateers together with their families. This year, in consideration of the safe management measures that need to be put in place due to the COVID-19 crisis, we have taken a different approach to celebrating the event.  
  
The theme this year **‘Dream, Discover, Destiny’** is especially pertinent in this current crisis. Learning is a lifelong pursuit and no matter the challenges and changes we have to adapt to, Changkateers must continue to learn, reflect and grow so that they can pursue their dreams, discover boundless possibilities and embrace their destiny to play a critical role as active contributors in society. We encourage our Changkateers to appreciate how they are the masters of their own destiny and have the confidence to develop as individuals imbued with a strong moral compass, as well as equipped with 21st century skills and dispositions to see through this crisis and thrive in the future.  
  
Thank you for joining us in the presentations as we celebrate the continued growth and achievements of our Changkateers!
