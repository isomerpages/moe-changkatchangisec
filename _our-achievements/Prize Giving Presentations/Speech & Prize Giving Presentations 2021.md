Celebrate with Gratitude, Learn with Passion
--------------------------------------------

The Annual Speech & Prize-Giving Day is an event for us to celebrate the achievements of our Changkateers together with their families.   
  

Changkat Changi Secondary School reaches a new milestone this year as we celebrate our 55th Anniversary. This is an opportunity for us to reflect on our school’s growth over the years. The 55th Anniversary logo is a representation of our school’s journey from its founding year in 1966 at the old campus, to our new campus where we have been situated from 2001 till today. We celebrate with gratitude on how far the school has come.
