**Caring Community, Empowering Lives**  

  

The Annual Speech & Prize-Giving Day is an event for us to celebrate the achievements of our Changkateers together with their families and the progress of the school for the past year.

Our theme for this year is ‘Caring Community, Empowering Lives’. In Changkat, we aim to help our students discover and make the best of their talents. Through being in a safe and supportive community filled with care and gratitude, we wish to help them realise their full potential. 

In Changkat, we aim to encourage our students to reimagine the possibilities and challenge their limits. In doing so, we hope to empower their lives by giving them the confidence to learn and excel, in and beyond the gates of Changkat Changi Secondary School.
