History
-------

The idea of the alumni association was first mooted at the re-union dinner for former students and teachers held in 2001 to mark the 35th anniversary of the school. Given that the school premises were about be moved from its former location at Jalan Tiga Ratus to the current site at Simei Street 23, Mrs Mabel Leong, who was the principal then, and some concerned former students thought it was imperative to form a fraternity to maintain ties. As the cliché will have it, one thing led to another and the CCSSAA was formed.
