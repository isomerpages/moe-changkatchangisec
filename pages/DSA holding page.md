### **Talent Area: STEM - AEROSPACE AND AVIATION**

##### Introduction  

In 2015, Changkat Changi Secondary School started our Applied Learning Programme titled Student-centered Opportunities for AeRospace industry (SOAR).

  

SOAR aims to develop Changkateers by connecting Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) knowledge across subject disciplines and developing thinking skills by providing a safe environment for Changkateers to stretch their imagination. It also aims to prepare Changkateers for the future by appreciating the relevance of their learning beyond the classroom, provide authentic situations for Changkateers to apply STEM knowledge to address real world problems, and explore STEM-related post-secondary and career opportunities.

  

All lower secondary Changkateers undergo weekly ALP lessons based on the context of Aviation where they learn about Principles of Flight, build gliders and practise drone programming. Students who show interest and aptitude will receive opportunities to participate in competitions such as Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition (SAFMC), attend workshops conducted by our tertiary partners such as Singapore Polytechnic, and participate in aviation exchange programme and visit the aviation hub in Toulouse, France.

##### FAQ

1.  **How many places can CCSS offer in DSA Exercise?**  
    All secondary schools can admit up to 20% of their 2024 S1 non-Integrated Programme (non-IP) intake via the DSA-Sec. This allows students to better access&nbsp;school programmes to grow their talents and interests through DSA.  
      
    
2.  **How does it value-add to my child?**  
    Your child will grow in their STEM knowledge and thinking skills. The exposure to authentic industry experiences and real-world applications will ensure that your child is better prepared for the new Industry 4.0.  
      
    
3.  **My child is an international student / Home-schooled / returning Singapore Citizen / SPR not studying in a local school. Can he/she apply for DSA?**  
    Other applicants not studying in MOE mainstream primary schools need to apply for a Registration Number (RGxxxxxxx) before they can apply through the DSA-Sec Portal. Schools may refer them to MOE website at:&nbsp;[https://go.gov.sg/nmsdsa-sec-application](https://go.gov.sg/nmsdsa-sec-application)  
      
    Applicants who are not studying in MOE mainstream primary schools include Returning Singaporeans, International Students studying overseas or in local international schools, students in Special Education Schools (e.g. Pathlight) and home-schoolers. For all shortlisted International Students, schools should remind them that they are required to take and fulfil the requirements of the Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS) test to be successful in DSA.&nbsp;

Those who take up Confirmed Offers are guaranteed a place in the school that has extended them an offer, provided that their PSLE results meet the minimum requirement for a course \[Express/ Normal (Academic)/ Normal (Technical)\] offered by the school. Should the child obtain a PSLE score that lies between 2 streams, he/she will be able to opt for the preferred stream.
		
5.  **Can my child/ward apply for transfer after getting a confirmed place?**  
    Students are also&nbsp;**NOT**&nbsp;allowed to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results. They are expected to honour the commitment to the posted DSA schools for the duration of the programme they are admitted to.
