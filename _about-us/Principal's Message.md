<h2>2025 Principal's Message</h2>
<h3><strong>Upholding Integrity, Engaging Minds</strong></h3>
<p>Dear Members of the Changkat Community,</p>
<p>We have many things to celebrate and be grateful for in 2025. The staff
and students here made the positive difference!</p>
<p>As a community, we have achieved excellence in many areas that we can
be proud of. We have achieved value-added performance in academic areas.
In particular, 100% of our Secondary Four Express and Five (Normal Academic)
students are eligible for post-secondary education. Of which, about half
of them qualify for Junior College or Millenia Institute studies. Our alumni,
Chow Tsz Ching and Yu Chen Hao (both from 2022 batch) who had progressed
to Hwa Chong Institution and Raffles Institution respectively, had done
well for their ‘A’ Levels. Tsz Ching was highlighted by Hwa Chong Institution
for her outstanding holistic achievements and Chen Hao earned an admission
to Oxford University to pursue his undergraduate studies!</p>
<p>Our Track &amp; Field Boys kept the Changkat flag flying high at the National
School Games representing the school in five finals – this is the best
track performance in more than a decade for Changkat! Most notably, Rico
Tan Jun Hong (from 4B) achieved 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> position
in the 400 m Finals (B Boys) and 400 m Hurdles Finals (B Boys) respectively
and our C Boys (Molina John David Naputo from 2A, Hazwan Bin Hazman from
2A, Magbitang Cale Timothy Acuna from 2G and Muhammad Irfan Danish from
1G) achieved 7<sup>th</sup> position in the 4 by 400 m Relay Finals. Our
Netball C Division Girls won all their matches in the classification games
to top the Table and qualify for National School Games League 3. This is
a remarkable achievement and the best performance from the Netball C Division
Girls so far!</p>
<p>All our Uniformed Groups continue to attain the Gold or Distinction Awards
for their units. In Boys’ Brigade, five of our boys (Seth Ngin Zhi Heng
from 4A, Hew Zi Feng from 4D, Ng Zhi Rong from 4D, Tan Wei Hong from 4D
and Julian Cedrick Santiago Andaya from 4F) are awarded the <strong>Founder’s Award</strong>!
This award is the highest and most prestigious award in the Seniors Programme.
Noor Sarahfina Binte Mohamed Amir (from 4B) from Girl Guides achieved the <strong>Baden Powell Award</strong>.
This is the highest award given out by the Chief Commissioner to a Girl
Guide.</p>
<p>At the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, our Performing Arts
CCAs have done us proud and continue to achieve Distinction and Accomplishment
awards.</p>

<p>Our Chinese String Ensemble is hence featured in Zaobao in June this year
(<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.zaobao.com.sg/news/singapore/story20250617-6673817</a>)
for our Direct Schools Admissions attractiveness and initiatives.</p>
<p>Individual Changkateers have strived hard to become the best in their
respective fields. I wish to highlight some of their outstanding achievements.
Our Malay Language Talent Development Programme (TDP) students took part
in the annual <strong>National NUS Poetry Recital Competition</strong> and
our team clinched the top spot! The team comprised Abdul Matin Bin Abdullah
(from 2C), Naila Khalisya Binte Abdul Samad (from 3G), Nur Iqmal Yaqin
Bin Shaerul Nizam (from 4D) and Hanan Falisha Binte Fakhruddin (from 5A).
This result makes Changkat the defending Champions for three years in a
row (2023, 2024 and 2025)! Nur Iqmal Yaqin Bin Shaerul Nizam (from 4D)
also achieved the Best Poet Award for the second time (his first time in
2023). We are also one of the six finalists (secondary school category)
in the recently held <strong>Katapella 2025</strong> – the first national-level
Malay choral recitation competition which is organized by Malay Language
Learning and Promotion Committee in partnership with Mediacorp. You can
catch our Changkateers in action in the finals on meWATCH! <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.mewatch.sg/watch/Katapella-E2-Secondary-Schools-554268</a>
</p>
<p>In the <strong>23rd National Chinese Creative Writing Competition</strong> organised
by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan, Yang Zhiyue (from 1D) was awarded the
2nd Prize (Lower Sec) and Huang Zichen (from 4A) was awarded Merit Prize
(Upper Sec). At the <strong>Chinese Language National Text Recital Competition</strong>,
Lee Xin Hui (from 4E) achieved 3<sup>rd</sup> position. In addition, six
of our Secondary 2 Humanities TDP students participated in the <strong>Ngee Ann Secondary Model United Nations (MUN) conference</strong>.
There were altogether 10 participating schools this year. I am pleased
to share that Rico Alexiah Marie Peralta (from 2A) and Nunez Marius Andru
Vidal (from 2D) received the Honourable Mention for Best Position Paper
of their respective councils. Alexiah was also chosen to present her Council’s
Resolution Paper at the closing ceremony. Our Changkateers also participated
in the <strong>SISTEMIC Explorer Challenge</strong> organised by National
Junior College competition and obtained the Silver Medal. The students
are Rico Alexiah Marie Peralta (from 2A), Harita Chandrasekar (from 2B),
Yashaswini Nannapaneni (from 2B), Harshit Kumar (from 2E) and Lim Kai Yang,
Stanley (from 2G). Rayden Soliano (from 3C) took home Bronze Medal for
the Youth Innovation Award in the <strong>Voyager Challenge</strong> in the
same competition. It is very inspiring to see our Changkateers from our
Talent Development Programme achieving excellence in the various competitions
they had participated in. This is made possible through the hard work of
teachers too. Well done Changkateers!</p>
<p>For the first time, our Learning for Life Programme team and Science Department
partnered with Metta School and Changkat Primary School to organise a biodiversity
trail and microgreens workshop for the Metta School students on 26 May.
Our students have learnt a lot from this meaningful collaboration. Our
LLP students had also set up a sustainability booth at Viasta! – the Changi
Simei Viaduct Festival. Throughout the day, our students contributed meaningfully
to the event with activities centered around green living, vibrancy, and
care. This truly exemplifies the spirit of serving with humility! For our
efforts in building a clean and green community through our Learning for
Life Programme (LLP) in Leadership in Sustainability, Changkat is awarded
the <strong>Excellence Award for Green Schools @ Southeast Awards 2025</strong>.
The teachers from the Malay Language Unit launched the <strong>boardgame ‘SABOTAJ’</strong> in
August in collaboration with the publisher Mini Monsters and the support
of the Malay Language Learning and Promotion Committee. This innovative
boardgame created entirely by our team injects a fun element of gaming
or gamification into Malay language learning and 800 sets of the game were
produced and had been distributed to all primary, secondary and madrasah
schools in Singapore! <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://berita.mediacorp.sg/singapura/permainan-sabotaj-suntik-elemen-gamifikasi-dalam-pembelajaran-bahasa-dan-budaya-melayu-964756?cid=internal_sharetool_web_20082025_berita</a>
</p>
<p>We achieved excellence while prioritising the well-being and positive
learning of both staff and students. The theme this year is ‘<strong>Upholding Integrity, Engaging Minds</strong>’.
The theme logo, designed by our Art teacher Ms Edith Cheng, shows two upright,
symmetrical blue hands which represent a strong commitment to integrity,
while the surrounding plants symbolise growth and the quest for knowledge.
The theme captures our hope that staff and students can uphold ethical
principles and have the moral courage to stand up for what is right. We
also hope to further customise the curriculum and opportunities and sustain
strong partnerships with stakeholders and industries to cater to the different
interests, abilities and needs of our students.In May, CCSS successfully
led two Overseas Recce Trips –– one to Shanghai and Hong Kong, China for
our Applied Learning Programme in Aviation &amp; Aerospace and another
to Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam for our Learning for Life Programme in Leadership
in Sustainability and Humanities programme. In Shanghai, we have established
partnerships with the <strong>Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Xuhui High School</strong> and
in Hong Kong, we have established partnership with the <strong>Pan Asia Pacific Aviation Services Limited (PAPAS)</strong>.
These newly established partnerships will provide more Changkateers the
opportunities to benefit from a future-ready and holistic education. Through
these student exchange overseas trips, we hope to develop our Changkateers’
confidence, deepen their understanding of foreign cultures and broaden
their global perspectives.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am grateful to all our partners, stakeholders, parents/guardians and
staff who have helped our Changkateers to ‘Thrive and Flourish’. Even as
we look forward to celebrate our 60<sup>th</sup> Anniversary in 2026, we
will remember our timeless value of ‘Upholding Integrity’ so that we can
continue ‘Engaging Minds’ for excellence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, We Flourish.</p>

<h2>2024 Principal's Message</h2>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Lead with Respect, Serve with Humility</strong></h3>
<p>Dear Members of the Changkat Community,</p>
<p>It is a new year and a new beginning. Having led this wonderful school
for three years now, we are still thinking about how we can do things differently
and more meaningfully. Here in Changkat, we seek continuous improvement.
We are thankful that many of our stakeholders and partners had stepped
forward to request for collaboration with Changkat or provide opportunities
for our Changkateers. Through these partnerships, we are inspired to lead
and serve better.</p>
<p>Recent world developments underscore the fact that we are living in uncertain
times. There are no longer straightforward solutions or one sole perspective
to an issue. Education has to prepare our students for an uncertain world
– for our students to embrace diversity of views, participate in respectful
discourse and serve the community while understanding differences.</p>
<p>Hence, in 2024, our school theme will be ‘<strong><em>Lead with Respect, Serve with Humility’</em></strong>.
The theme captures our wish to take pride in what we do and that we believe
we have the strengths to enable the school to succeed. As educators, we
believe in the potential of students - that their minds, character and
lives can be shaped. We also value learning from one another, being of
service to others and encouraging others to succeed. As members of this
Changkat family, we respect the community, including norms and expectations,
to build a safe, supportive and happy school community. When we can learn
to respect others and their perspectives, only then we can stay humble.
Staying humble ensures that we do not remain contented. We listen keenly
and we ask curious questions. We are excited to learn new knowledge, experiment
with effective and innovative teaching practices and pedagogies.</p>
<p>The theme logo, designed by our Art teacher Mdm Angeline Neo Swee Ting,
is inspired by the rice plant and the phrase that best describes this humble
plant – ‘<strong>The more you know, the lower you bow</strong>’. This phrase
epitomises the value of humility and respect as we liken ourselves to that
of the rice plant. As we age and go through life, our experiences fill
and shape us. In drawing inspiration from the plant, we are encouraged
to be humble and respect one another. This logo inspires us to have respect
for self, students, people and the community.</p>

<p>Our school values, iCAR2E (Integrity, Care, grAtitude, Respect, Resilience,
Excellence), are the foundation that guides us to achieve our beliefs and
shape our culture of Care, Learning and Excellence. Our school believes
that every child can achieve success through effort and resilience, and
has a role to play within the community to improve the lives of others.</p>
<p>In alignment to this theme, we will continue to prioritise and deepen
our efforts in three key areas this year, namely in Positive Education,
Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and Blended Learning. Positive
Education is the main approach to guide our school’s teaching and learning
direction. In doing so, we would focus on enhancing Engagement and Accomplishment
this year. Under CCE, we would focus on developing growth mindset, cyberwellness
education, peer support and civic literacy. In Blended Learning, we would
further deepen our e-pedagogy practices, develop student-initiated learning,
teach effective study skills and reinforce thinking routines. We will also
be starting our overseas trips to our partner schools in Toulouse, France
and Jinan, China this year.</p>
<p>Last year, we celebrated our 57th Anniversary and the school theme was
‘Growing Resilience, Enriching Character’. We hoped to build on our strength
as a resilient community. There were indeed many moments and achievements
that we can be thankful for as Changkateers. Our hard work in focusing
on holistic development of students has resulted in positive outcomes in
various fields, such as national examinations performances, National School
Games, Co-Curricular activities and Talent Development Programmes. Our
staff were also recognised both internally and externally for their outstanding
contributions. On reflection, the years 2021 to 2023 consolidated our learning
and teaching foundation so that we can now position ourselves to thrive
for excellence in the next three years.</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to warmly welcome our Secondary
One Changkateers, parents/guardians, new staff members and new partners
joining our big Changkat family. With the support of parents/guardians,
staff, School Advisory Committee, alumni and friends, our hope is that
you will find your experience in Changkat to be a positive one. You will
find Changkat to be a place where you belong and everyone has a space and
platform to contribute to the community. We desire to be a community where <strong>Together, We Flourish</strong>.</p>
<p>As a team, I believe that we can build Changkat to be an innovative school
of choice that fuels the dreams and ambitions of our students and staff
to succeed. Let us work together to define different pathways of success
and make this possible for everyone. On behalf of the school, I wish that
2024 will be a year filled with peace, joy and love for everyone!</p>
<p>Together, We Flourish.</p>

<h2>2023 Principal's Message</h2>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Growing Resilience, Enriching Character</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1 January 2023</strong>
</p>
<p>Dear Members of the Changkat Community,</p>
<p>Welcome to the new academic year and to all our new Changkateers (students
and staff), welcome to Changkat! Having led this amazing school for two
years now, I am still learning new things about Changkat every single day.
Few things give me more joy than talking to students and staff, hearing
their questions, understanding their challenges and celebrating their successes
(and we have much to celebrate). In the past year, I had the opportunity
to connect with many stakeholders too. Through these conversations, I am
deeply inspired and they allow me to see the world with fresh eyes.</p>
<p>We are living in challenging times. The world is rapidly changing. Education
has to prepare our students differently – for our students to develop the
resilience to adapt to changes, embrace diversity of views, participate
in respectful discourse and collaborate effectively across differences.</p>
<p>In 2023, our school theme will be <strong><em>"Growing Resilience, Enriching Character"</em></strong> The
theme encapsulates our vision for staff and students to bounce forward
and persevere when faced with challenges and to be adaptable to changes.
We hope that staff and students can grow in their resilience so that they
can recover from challenges and changes and respond with commitment and
optimism. Through deepening our culture of care and support, we hope to
enrich the character of students through strengthening our student development
curriculum and opportunities (such as Character and Citizenship Education,
Learning for Life Programme, Co-Curricular Activities, Student-Initiated
Learning and Talent Development Programme).</p>
<p>The theme logo, designed by our Art teacher Mr Soo Sheng Lih, consists
of a soft round-edge square which evokes the sense of stability and depicts
strength and solid foundation, where the character of resilience is molded
and developed. A star in the middle of Growing Resilience and Enriching
Character suggests that success comes from these two (hand in hand). Integrated
with a contrasting soft leaves-pattern, the leaves portray a youthful,
graceful and vitalizing new energy that spring up out of the seed of the
school logo, reaching out to the world with grace and harmony. Growing
out from the nurturing warm environment, Changkateers reach out to the
world carrying the positive values and character of Changkat.</p>

growth mindset, cyberwellness education and student leadership. In Blended
Learning, we would further deepen our e-pedagogy practices, develop student-initiated
learning, teach effective study skills and reinforce thinking routines.
We will also be revamping our Learning for Life Programme curriculum to
focus on developing Leaders in Sustainability – to nurture leaders who
can understand sustainability issues and challenges so that they are better
equipped for the future to tackle a complex global environmental crisis.</p>
<p>Last year, we celebrated our 56th Anniversary and the school theme was
‘Caring Community, Empowering Lives’. We hoped to build on our strength
as a caring community as people are Changkat’s strengths. There were indeed
many moments and achievements that we can be thankful for as Changkateers.
Our hard work in focusing on holistic development of students has resulted
in positive outcomes in various fields, such as Quality of Students’ Experiences,
national examinations performances, National School Games, Co-Curricular
activities and Talent Development Programmes. Our staff were also recognised
both internally and externally for their outstanding contributions. Looking
back, 2022 captured our desire to empower Changkateers to learn with joy
and passion, so that they can thrive and flourish.</p>
<p>I would like to warmly welcome our Secondary One Changkateers, parents
/ guardians and new staff members joining our big Changkat family. With
the support of parents / guardians, staff, School Advisory Committee, alumni

will have opportunities to grow your unique strengths and interests driven
by your passion to learn, serve and succeed. A community where <strong><em>Together, We Flourish</em></strong>.
Our school motto ‘Through School to Nation’ reminds us that Changkat Changi
plays an important role to cultivate active citizenry for a united society.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the support you have rendered to the school. Our work
at Changkat Changi is not yet complete but I believe that together, we
can build Changkat to be a nurturing school that matches the ambitions
and hopes of our students and staff. On behalf of the school, I would like
to wish you a healthy and successful 2023!</p>

<br>Dear Members of the Changkat Community,</p>
<p>A warm welcome to the new academic year! In the past year, I had the opportunity
to connect with many of you. I am grateful for the support you have rendered
to the school. 2021 had been an extraordinary year for many of us as we
encountered various challenges brought about by the COVID-19 situation.
Yet, in the face of these difficult moments, we did not lose our strength
and purpose. In Changkat, we resolve to focus even more on the positive
well-being and learning of staff and students.</p>

<p>In 2022, our school theme will be ‘<strong><em>Caring Community, Empowering Lives’</em></strong>.
The theme encapsulates our vision to&nbsp;value each other, put ourselves
in the shoes of others and seek to bring out the best in everyone. We hope
to build a safe and supportive community filled with care and gratitude.
We want to support our staff and students and give them the confidence
to learn and excel. We also hope to empower the lives of staff and students
through the taking in of their voices and re-imagining the possibilities.
The theme logo, designed by our Art teacher Ms Sim Jia En,&nbsp;has two
Cs (representing ‘Changkat Changi’) that form a circle. Within the circle,
three figurines represent the community of students, staff and partners.
Two figurines form a heart shape highlighting the value of care we have

<h2>2021 Principal's Message</h2>
<p>Dear Members of the Changkat Community,</p>
<p>I am humbled to have the opportunity to lead this amazing school. Since
my appointment was announced in October this year, I have connected with
many of you. In these couple of months, I experienced first-hand the caring
and supportive Changkat culture I have heard about on numerous occasions.
Thank you for the warm welcome and the support rendered in preparing me
for my new responsibilities.</p>
<p>I would like to extend this warm welcome to our Secondary One Changkateers
and the parents / guardians joining our big Changkat family. With the support
of parents / guardians, staff, School Advisory Committee, alumni and friends,
we believe that your transition to secondary school life will be a positive
experience. You will find Changkat to be a place where you will have opportunities
to grow your unique strengths and interests driven by your passion to learn,
serve and succeed.</p>
<p>I also look forward to welcoming and meeting the Secondary Two, Three,
Four and Five Changkateers and school staff in the new academic year. The
new year is a chance for the Changkat family to commit ourselves to create
a vibrant learning community where Changkateers will Learn with Passion,
Serve with Humility and Succeed with Integrity. Apart from our niche programmes
in Aerospace and Aviation (our Applied Learning Programme) and Service
and Leadership (our Learning for Life Programme), Changkateers can look
forward to a richer learning experience through the implementation of Positive
Education, Blended Learning and use of a new facility - Dream Lab. We will
focus our efforts to strengthen the Changkateer Graduate Outcomes while
being anchored on school values, iCAR2E (integrity, Care, GrAtitude, Respect,
Resilience, Excellence).</p>
<p>Established in 1966, Changkat Changi Secondary School has come a long
way. Under the able leadership of Ms Sharma Poonam and many other Principals
before her, Changkat Changi Secondary School has had many achievements
that we can be proud of. We will continue to build on their fine work and
keep the Changkat Changi flag flying high! As we celebrate our 55th Anniversary
in 2021, it also marks 20 years since our relocation to the current premises
at 23 Simei Street 3 in 2001. The Simei community has welcomed us warmly
in these past 20 years and we look forward to working closely with our
community as we scale new heights.</p>
<p>Our school motto ‘Through School to Nation’ reminds us that Changkat Changi
plays an important role to cultivate responsible and committed citizens
for a cohesive society. Our work at Changkat Changi is not yet complete
but I believe that together, we can achieve our Vision. We will therefore
remember 2021 by celebrating our heritage and achievements and, at the
same time, welcoming and realising our dreams of past, present and future
Changkateers.</p>
<p>A warm welcome to the new academic year and best wishes for 2021!</p>
