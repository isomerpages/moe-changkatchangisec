<p>Welcome to Changkat Changi Secondary School!
<br>
<br>I am delighted to serve as the 11th Principal of this established school
with a rich 60-year history. Our journey began humbly at Jalan Tiga Ratus
in 1966, and we have been a cornerstone of the Simei community for the
past 25 years. As we celebrate our 60th anniversary in 2026, this milestone
offers us an excellent opportunity to honour those who came before us and
reflect on our school's next chapter.
<br>
<br><strong>Thrive Together, Inspire Excellence</strong> – This year's theme
reflects our core belief that all Changkateers can thrive together and,
as Team Changkat Changi, inspire excellence in those around us.
<br>
<br>At Changkat Changi Secondary School (CCSS), we prepare students for an
ever-evolving future shaped by technological advancement and global change.
We emphasise character development, nurturing emotionally literate and
resilient students who are proactive in caring for others.&nbsp; These
qualities will help our students form strong friendships during their secondary
school years.
<br>
<br>Beyond academics, our Changkateers enjoy a rich, memorable and varied
schooling experience that provides them with numerous opportunities to
explore new experiences, as well as to better appreciate their strengths
and deepen their learning.&nbsp; Their school experience will feature our
distinctive programmes, learning journeys, and engaging CCAs.&nbsp; &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), SOAR at CCSS, focuses on Aerospace
and Aviation Management, offering students aviation-related activities
and enrichment. With Changi Airport Terminal 5's development, our Changkateers
gain valuable insights and skills for the aviation industry.
<br>
<br>We also ensure our students connect with the community whilst considering
a sustainable future. Through ASCEND at CCSS, our Learning for Life Programme
(LLP), students embark on a meaningful journey in Leadership and Sustainability.
<br>
<br>As Changkat Changi Secondary School steps into the future, we welcome
your support and partnership in developing tomorrow's leaders who will
help create a better Singapore and world.</p>
<p><strong>Through School to Nation.</strong>
