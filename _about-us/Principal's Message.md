Dear Members of the Changkat Community,

A warm welcome to the new academic year! In the past year, I had the opportunity to connect with many of you. I am grateful for the support you have rendered to the school. 2021 had been an extraordinary year for many of us as we encountered various challenges brought about by the COVID-19 situation. Yet, in the face of these difficult moments, we did not lose our strength and purpose. In Changkat, we resolve to focus even more on the positive well-being and learning of staff and students.

Last year, we celebrated our 55th Anniversary and the school theme was ‘Celebrate with Gratitude, Learn with Passion’. There were indeed many moments and achievements that we can be thankful for as Changkateers. Our hard work in focusing on holistic development of students has resulted in positive outcomes in various fields, such as national examinations performances, Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentations, Co-Curricular activities and Talent Development Programmes. Our staff were also recognised both internally and externally for their outstanding and innovative work. Looking back, 2021 captured our desire to teach Changkateers the value of gratitude and to motivate them to learn with joy and passion, so that they can thrive and flourish.

In 2022, our school theme will be ‘**_Caring Community, Empowering Lives’_**. The theme encapsulates our vision to value each other, put ourselves in the shoes of others and seek to bring out the best in everyone. We hope to build a safe and supportive community filled with care and gratitude. We want to support our staff and students and give them the confidence to learn and excel. We also hope to empower the lives of staff and students through the taking in of their voices and re-imagining the possibilities. The theme logo, designed by our Art teacher Ms Sim Jia En, has two Cs (representing ‘Changkat Changi’) that form a circle. Within the circle, three figurines represent the community of students, staff and partners. Two figurines form a heart shape highlighting the value of care we have for one another.

Our school values, iCAR2E (integrity, Care, grAtitude, Respect, Resilience, Excellence), are the anchor that guides us to achieve our belief and shape our culture. Our school believes that every child can achieve success through effort and resilience, and that as one Changkat family, we can scale greater heights together.  

In alignment to this theme, we will hence prioritise our effort in three key areas this year, namely in Positive Education, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and Blended Learning. Positive Education is the main approach to guide our school’s teaching and learning direction. In doing so, we would focus on enhancing Relationships and Emotions this year. Under CCE, we would focus on the discussion of contemporary issues, cyberwellness education, strengthening peer support relationships and teacher-student relationships and support for mental health. In Blended Learning, we would further deepen our e-pedagogy practices, develop student-initiated learning, teach effective study skills and reinforce positive classroom routines.

I would like to warmly welcome our Secondary One Changkateers, parents / guardians and new staff members joining our big Changkat family. With the support of parents / guardians, staff, School Advisory Committee, alumni and friends, we believe that your transition to Changkat will be a positive experience. You will find Changkat to be a place where you will have opportunities to grow your unique strengths and interests driven by your passion to learn, serve and succeed. A community where **Together, We Flourish**. This is Changkat and this is our Vision. Our school motto ‘Through School to Nation’ reminds us that Changkat Changi plays an important role to cultivate responsible and committed citizens for a cohesive society. Our work at Changkat Changi is not yet complete but I believe that together, we can achieve our Vision. 

We look forward to a meaningful year of learning with all of you. We wish for 2022 to inspire us to care even more for the community around us and provide us with better times and hope for the future. On behalf of the school, I would like to wish you a peaceful and joyful 2022!

Together, We Flourish.

2021 Principal's Message
------------------------

Dear Members of the Changkat Community,  

I am humbled to have the opportunity to lead this amazing school. Since my appointment was announced in October this year, I have connected with many of you. In these couple of months, I experienced first-hand the caring and supportive Changkat culture I have heard about on numerous occasions. Thank you for the warm welcome and the support rendered in preparing me for my new responsibilities.  

I would like to extend this warm welcome to our Secondary One Changkateers and the parents / guardians joining our big Changkat family. With the support of parents / guardians, staff, School Advisory Committee, alumni and friends, we believe that your transition to secondary school life will be a positive experience. You will find Changkat to be a place where you will have opportunities to grow your unique strengths and interests driven by your passion to learn, serve and succeed.  

I also look forward to welcoming and meeting the Secondary Two, Three, Four and Five Changkateers and school staff in the new academic year. The new year is a chance for the Changkat family to commit ourselves to create a vibrant learning community where Changkateers will Learn with Passion, Serve with Humility and Succeed with Integrity. Apart from our niche programmes in Aerospace and Aviation (our Applied Learning Programme) and Service and Leadership (our Learning for Life Programme), Changkateers can look forward to a richer learning experience through the implementation of Positive Education, Blended Learning and use of a new facility - Dream Lab. We will focus our efforts to strengthen the Changkateer Graduate Outcomes while being anchored on school values, iCAR2E (integrity, Care, GrAtitude, Respect, Resilience, Excellence).  

Established in 1966, Changkat Changi Secondary School has come a long way. Under the able leadership of Ms Sharma Poonam and many other Principals before her, Changkat Changi Secondary School has had many achievements that we can be proud of. We will continue to build on their fine work and keep the Changkat Changi flag flying high! As we celebrate our 55th Anniversary in 2021, it also marks 20 years since our relocation to the current premises at 23 Simei Street 3 in 2001. The Simei community has welcomed us warmly in these past 20 years and we look forward to working closely with our community as we scale new heights.  

Our school motto ‘Through School to Nation’ reminds us that Changkat Changi plays an important role to cultivate responsible and committed citizens for a cohesive society. Our work at Changkat Changi is not yet complete but I believe that together, we can achieve our Vision. We will therefore remember 2021 by celebrating our heritage and achievements and, at the same time, welcoming and realising our dreams of past, present and future Changkateers.  

A warm welcome to the new academic year and best wishes for 2021!
