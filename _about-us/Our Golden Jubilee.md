The Year 2016 marks 50 years since Changkat Changi Secondary School’s (CCSS) first day began. In the months leading to the milestone, there were a series of celebratory activities.  
  
The theme for our 50th Anniversary Celebration is about Appreciating the Past, Celebrating the Present and Inspiring the Future. As we celebrate Changkat’s Golden Jubilee, we aim to showcase our achievements, as well as past and current programmes and activities that sought to bring out the best in our students.
