The Year 2016 marks 50 years since Changkat Changi Secondary School’s (CCSS) first day began. In the months leading to the milestone, there were a series of celebratory activities.  
  
The theme for our 50th Anniversary Celebration is about Appreciating the Past, Celebrating the Present and Inspiring the Future. As we celebrate Changkat’s Golden Jubilee, we aim to showcase our achievements, as well as past and current programmes and activities that sought to bring out the best in our students.

In the logo, the paper planes symbolize the ALP programme we have implaced in our curriculum. It reflects the character of our fellow students who would endeavour to strive for the best. The green in the plane symbolises prosperity, freshness and progress. The different shades of green represent growth and balance. Green is also our school colour, which has the meaning of youth and vitality.  
  
The light blue represents the sky, which is associated with open spaces and freedom. We hope with the freedom of choice given to the students,they will chase after their dreams and aspirations.  
  
Changkat 50 is a reminder that Changkat has always been a second home to many - a place that stays in the heart of all students, alumni, parents, principals, vice-principals, teachers and all working staff. We are a family who stays united and we all aim to work together harmoniously. Our strong relations, past and present, is represented by the solid blue semi-circular base, while our binding ties and rapport is represented by the white and blue circles. Together they symbolize unity and wholeness.
