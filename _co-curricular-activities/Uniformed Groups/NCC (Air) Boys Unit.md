<h3>CCA Objectives</h3>
<p>Established in 2003, the Changkat Changi Secondary School NCC (Air) Boys
squadron aims to instill in our students the NCC Core Values of Loyalty
to Country, Discipline, Leadership, Uprightness, Commitment and Responsibility,
Care for Fellow Cadets, Adventurous Spirit and Safety. Through the numerous
programmes, activities and competitions, we hope to train students to become
Cadet Strong, possessing a Resilient Mind, Fit Body and Committed Heart.
In this way, we align with NCC in its Mission - To nurture inspiring leaders
and committed citizens through fun, adventurous and military-related activities,
and help to realise its Vision - Extraordinary Youth Leaders.</p>
<p>In the last five years, NCC (Air) Boys have done consistently well in
meeting all the requirements of the work-year. We received a Distinction
for our unit performance in the Unit Recognition from 2020 to 2024. This
is a testament to our continuous hard work in planning, organising and
conducting training to interest and engage our cadets in NCC and ensuring
our cadets do their best.</p>
<p>Through their journey with NCC, cadets can expect to learn the values,
skills and knowledge required of a soldier and get a glimpse of NS life.
They will learn and be tested on their competencies in the NCC curriculum.
They will also undergo physical training to improve their fitness in order
to participate in competitions. To show their commitment to NCC, cadets
will attend CCA regularly to complete all training and represent the school
unit in competitions. They will also attend major events in school and
special events at army camps. Cadets who perform well and have leadership
potential will be sent for upgrading courses.</p>
<p>We hope that in graduating with our NCC experience, our cadets will carry
with them the requisite values, skills and knowledge into their Institute
of Highter Learning. They may consider taking up courses in aerospace or
aviation or pursue a career in the RSAF in future. Most importantly, when
called upon, they must always be ready – To Serve With Pride and Dedication
