##### School CCA Policy

1.  Every student must have at least ONE CCA throughout their 4 or 5 year stay in school.
2.  Students are encouraged only to participate in one CCA. Students who wish to have more than one CCA are to approach the HOD/SH CCA for approval.
3.  Students are not allowed to change CCA unless with the approval of HOD / SH CCA, in which case only those with serious medical grounds will be considered.
4.  When persistent absenteeism and misbehavior occurs, the student may be subject to disciplinary action.
5.  All pupils must be in their proper PE/CCA attire when reporting and participating in their CCA activities.
