### CCA Objectives

  
In this CCA, we hope to instill the values of commitment, self-discipline and perseverance to our members. They take pride in representing the school in competitions, and always give their best in the pursuit of breaking their personal bests. Trainings, especially during the peak season, may sound arduous, but our members enjoy the process of training together and bonding with one another. It is the close friendship forged and continuous improvements they make which motivate them to train even harder.
