<h3>CCA Objectives</h3>
<p>In this CCA, we hope to instill the values of commitment, self-discipline
and perseverance to our members. They take pride in representing the school
in competitions, and always give their best in the pursuit of breaking
their personal bests. Trainings, especially during the peak season, may
sound arduous, but our members enjoy the process of training together and
bonding with one another. It is the close friendship forged and continuous
improvements they make which motivate them to train even harder.</p>
